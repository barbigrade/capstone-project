## An app for the lazy bread lover
Daily Bread is a baked goods delivery app developed for bread aficionados craving a croissant  
on a Sunday morning who are too ~~busy~~ *lazy* to leave the comfort of their own home. 

The app was built with Next.js and developed as my capstone project in the final four weeks of  
the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp in September/October 2022.

Make sure to set up your browser to responsive mode (iPhone SE) as the app is optimized for mobile usage.  
Find it [here](https://dailybread.vercel.app/) or a sneak peek below ü•ê
